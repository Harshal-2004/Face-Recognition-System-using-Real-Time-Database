# 🎯 Face Recognition System using Real-Time Database

Welcome to the **Face Recognition System with MongoDB Integration** — a practical project that implements real-time face detection and recognition using Python. This project is ideal for real-world applications such as **attendance management**, **secure access**, and **live monitoring**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system enables you to:

- Detect and recognize faces from a **live webcam/video feed**
- Store and retrieve face data using a **real-time MongoDB database**
- Support use cases like **automated attendance marking**, **authentication**, and more

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (Face detection & recognition)
- **NumPy**
- **MongoDB** (Real-time database)
- **Tkinter** (Simple UI interface)
- Other Python libraries as needed

---

## 📦 Key Features

- ✅ Real-time face detection & recognition  
- ✅ Easy new face enrollment  
- ✅ Live attendance marking with timestamps  
- ✅ MongoDB real-time sync  
- ✅ Optional user interface for smooth interaction  
- ✅ Scalable & modular architecture

## 📸 Demo

Below is a step-by-step demonstration of how the application works:

| Step | Screenshot | Caption |
|------|------------|---------|
| 1. Face Detected Encoded & Information Page | ![Step 1 Placeholder](demo/Sundar_Attend.png) | As soon as a face appears in the frame, the system detects and encodes the face data. || After encoding, an information window pops up showing user details and confirmation. |
| 2. Attendance Marked | ![Step 4 Placeholder](demo/Sundar_Marked.png) | The system marks attendance and displays a success message. |
| 3. Re-Entry Within 30 Seconds | ![Step 5 Placeholder](demo/sundar_Already.png) | If the same face is detected again within 30 seconds, a notification appears: "Already marked." |

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Face Detection**  
   - Captures live frames using OpenCV  
   - Detects faces using Haar cascades or CNN models  

2. **Face Recognition**  
   - Compares input face with stored encodings  
   - Identifies or labels unknown faces  

3. **Database Integration**  
   - MongoDB stores user info and attendance logs  
   - Real-time updates ensure accurate tracking  

4. **User Interface (Optional)**  
   - Register new users  
   - View attendance records  
   - Search or delete entries
