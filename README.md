# Face Recognition System using Real-Time Database

Welcome to the Face Recognition System using Real-Time Database!  
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of real-time face recognition integrated with a live database, suitable for applications such as attendance management, security access, and more.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains code for a Face Recognition System that:

- Detects and recognizes faces from live camera/video feed.
- Stores and updates face data in a real-time database (e.g., Firebase).
- Can be used for attendance, authentication, or monitoring scenarios.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for face detection and recognition)
- **NumPy**
- **Firebase Realtime Database** (or other real-time database)
- **Tkinter** (for user interface, if included)
- Other supporting libraries as required

## 📦 Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Easy enrollment of new users/faces.
- Attendance marking with timestamps.
- Live update and retrieval from the database.
- Secure and scalable architecture.
- Simple UI for demonstration (optional).

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Face Detection:** Uses OpenCV to detect faces from a webcam or video stream.
2. **Face Recognition:** Matches detected faces against known faces stored in the database.
3. **Database Sync:** Updates attendance records and user info in the real-time database.
4. **User Interface:** (If present) Allows enrolling new faces, viewing attendance, etc.

## 📋 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshal-2004/Face-Recognition-System-using-Real-Time-Database.git
   cd Face-Recognition-System-using-Real-Time-Database
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your database**
   - Set up Firebase or your preferred real-time database.
   - Update the database configuration in `config.py` (or the relevant file).

4. **Run the system**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Enroll new users or test the recognition system as per instructions in the UI or CLI.**

## 📸 Sample Workflow

- Open the application.
- Register/enroll faces for recognition.
- The system captures faces, processes them, and stores the data securely.
- Recognized users are matched against the database and attendance/authentication is marked instantly.
